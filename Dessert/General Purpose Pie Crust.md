| **3 tbp** of rum | ice cold water |

1. Keep butter cold and in the fridge before use
2. Cut up the butter into small pieces
3. In a food processor, mix the flour with the butter, trying to keep the dough as cool as possible.
4. Add 1 shot of rum into the dough and continue to mix. 
5. Slowly add ice cold water, **1tbsp** at a time, until the dough takes shape (about **3tbsp** total)
6. When the dough is able to hold together, place it in the fridge for 30min
7. Generously cover the working surface with flour to prevent the dough from sticking when being rolled out
8. Roll the dough into a pie crust about 1.5" - 2.5” larger than the circumference of the pie plate, depending on how deep the pie dish is.
9. Place the crust over the pie pan, and gently lift and drop the crust into the pan. Pinch or crimp the exposed crust edge
10. Return the pie pan back into the fridge for 30 min
11. Preheat the oven to 325°F (or 300°F on convection bake)
12. Using a fork, poke holes into bottom of the pie crust
13. Cover the bottom of the pie in aluminum foil or parchment paper, and weigh down the centre of the pie with dried rice to help reducing the puffing of the dough
14. Bake the pie crust on the lowest rack of the oven for about 15 min
15. Remove the foil and rice, and return to the oven to back for another 7-9 minutes, until the crimped edges begin to brown
