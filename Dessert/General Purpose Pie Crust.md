|<!-- -->|<!-- -->|
|---|---|
| **115g** of unsalted butter |**225g** of all-purpose flour |
| **1/3 tsp** of granulated sugar | **1/3 tsp** of table salt |

1. Cut up the butter into small pieces
2. Mix the flour with the butter, trying to keep the dough as cool as possible. Add cold water to help the dough take shape (about **1/3 cup** total)
3. When the dough is able to hold together, place it in the fridge for 30min
4. Generously cover the working surface with flour to prevent the dough from sticking when being rolled out
5. Roll the dough into a pie crust about 1.5" - 2.5” larger than the circumference of the pie plate, depending on how deep the pie dish is.
6. Place the crust over the pie pan, and gently lift and drop the crust into the pan. Lift the sides of the pie crust up into ridges along the plate edge
7. Return the pie pan back into the fridge for 30 min
8. Preheat the oven to 400°F
9. Cover the rested pie in aluminum foil, and weigh down the centre of the pie with dried rice to help reducing the puffing of the dough
10. Bake the pie crust on the lowest rack of the oven for 12-15 min, until the crust just begins to turn colours.
11. Remove the foil and rice, poke holes into the bottom of the pie crust with a fork, and return to the oven to back for another 7-9 minutes
