## 2. Pie Fillings
|<!-- -->|<!-- -->|
|---|---|
| **1** small butternut squash | **3** large eggs |
| **1 tbsp** of maple syrup | **1 tsp** of vanilla extract |
|**1/2 cup** of honey | **1/2 can** of evaporated milk |
| **3 tsp** of pumpkin pie spice | **1/3 tsp** of table salt |
| **2 tbsp** of all-purpose flour | **1** 9" pie crust |

1. Cut the squash into pieces that can fit on a steamer trivet. Steam for at least 25 minutes.
2. When you can easily push a fork into the thickest part of the squash, remove from the steamer. 
3. Peel the squash skins away, and using a hand blender, puree the squash fruit.
4. Preheat the oven to 325°F (or 300°F on convection bake)
5. Continue to mix in **3** large eggs, maple syrup, vanilla extract, honey, evaporated milk, pumpkin spice, and table salt. 
6. Fill up the pie crusts with the pumpkin puree
7. Fill small oven safe bowls with excess pie fillings
8. Bake the pie, and any excess, for at least 25min.
9. Once the 25min has passed, check on the pie every 5-10 minutes. Aside from the outer 4in around the crust, the pie will still be wobbly when shaken.
10. If the edges of the crust is cooking faster than the pie, cover the edges of the pie with aluminum foils to prevent burning, and return to the oven
11. Serve after cooling for at least 15 minutes, but best when chilled in a fridge overnight. Top with toppings of your preference, such as some whipped cream, ground nutmeg, or pumpkin spice.
