|<!-- -->|<!-- -->|
|---|---|
| **150g** of unsalted butter |**2 cups** of all-purpose flour (240g) |
| **1/3 tsp** of granulated sugar | **1/3 tsp** of table salt |

1. Cut up the butter into small pieces
2. Mix the flour with the butter, trying to keep the dough as cool as possible. Add cold water to help the dough take shape (about 1/2 cup total)
3. When the dough is able to hold together, place it in the fridge ofr 30min
4. Generously cover the working surface with flour to prevent the dough from sticking when being rolled out
5. Roll the dough into a pie crust about 1.5" larger than the circumference of the pie plate.
6. Place the crust over the pie pan, and gently lift and drop the crust into the pan. Lift the sides of the pie crust up into ridges along the plate edge
7. Return the pie pan back into the fridge for 30 min
8. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F
9. Cover the rested pie in aluminum foil, and weigh down the centre of the pie with dried rice to help reducing the puffing of the dough
10. Bake the pie crust on the lowest rack of the oven for 12-15 min, until the crust just begins to turn colours.
11. Remove the foil and rice, poke holes into the bottom of the pie crust with a fork, and return to the oven to back for another 7-9 minutes

## 3. Pie Fillings
|<!-- -->|<!-- -->|
|---|---|
| **1** small butternut squash |**1/2 cup** of honey |
| **3 tsp** of pumpkin pie spice (or the main ingrediences mixed in a 3:2:2:1 ratio)| **1/3 tsp** of table salt |
| **3** large eggs | **1/2 can** of evaporated milk |

1. Cut the squash into pieces that can fit on a steamer trivet. Steam for 20 minutes
2. Peel the squash skins away, and using a hand blender, puree the squash fruit.
3. In a separate bowl, beat **3** large eggs, pumpkin spice, honey, salt and evaporated milk. 
4. Stir the mixture into the squash puree, and mix evenly
5. Fill up the pie crusts with the pumpkin puree
6. Fill small oven safe bowls with excess pie fillings
7. Bake the pie, and any excess, for 25min.
8. Once the 25min has passed, cover the edges of the pie with aluminum foils to prevent burning, and return to the oven
9. Check the pie every 5-10 minutes. Aside from the outer 4in around the crust, the pie will still be wobbly when shaken.
10. After about 30-40 total minutes of baking the pie filling, remove the pie, and allow the ceramic pie plates to continue cooking the pie.
11. Serve after cooling for 15 minutes, or surve chilled in a fridge with whipped cream.
