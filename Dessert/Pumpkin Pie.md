| **3 tsp** of pumpkin pie spice | **1/3 tsp** of table salt |
| **3** large eggs | **1/2 can** of evaporated milk |

4. Stir the mixture into the squash puree, and mix evenly
5. Fill up the pie crusts with the pumpkin puree
6. Fill small oven safe bowls with excess pie fillings

8. Once the 25min has passed, cover the edges of the pie with aluminum foils to prevent burning, and return to the oven
9. Check the pie every 5-10 minutes. Aside from the outer 4in around the crust, the pie will still be wobbly when shaken.
10. After about 25-35 minutes of baking, total, remove the pie, and allow the ceramic pie plates to continue cooking the pie.
11. Serve after cooling for 15 minutes, or serve after being chilled in a fridge overnight with toppings of your preference.
