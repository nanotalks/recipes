# Steven's Cookbook of Various Miscellaneous Recipes

This is my personal repository of miscellaneous recipes that I've curated and tweaked over the years to fit the palate of my family. Anyone is free to use, share and modify (in their own cookbooks) any of these recipes in anyway they see fit. These recipes are only meant to be read by myself and my family, so you will not find any fancy descriptions, history or origin story or tasting notes attached to any of the recipes (I honestly skip through most of those anecdotes online when I see them anyways). One day, I may upload and attach photos whenever I can muster up the time to do so.

Some of the recipes are written with specific tools or kitchen gadgets in mind (such as a sous vide machine), as those are the ones I happen to have at home. I have categorized those recipes in special folders, to help differentiate them from versions that may use more generic tools. I will list the model of these specific tools and gadgets in the folder README.md, not because I'm sponsored in anyways by them, but for others to use as a point of reference.

I do not claim that any of these recipes are authentic to their country of origin, nor is there any guarantee that any recipe will taste good to anyone other than my own family members :). Cook and taste at your own risk!
