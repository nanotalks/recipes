| **3-4 lbs** of chicken | **1 tsp** of table salt |
| **2 tbsp** of Shaoxing cooking wine | |

1. *Optional:* If using a whole chicken, bring the chicken out of the fridge 30min prior to cooking to allow the surface of the chicken to come to room temperature
2. Bring half a pot of water to a boil with the salt and cooking wine. Leave enough room in the pot for the chicken.
3. Once boiling, dip the chicken into the water. If using a whole chicken, make sure the boiling water goes into the body cavity.
4. Remove the chicken from the water, and allow the water to return to a boil.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 two additional times.
6. Place the chicken in the pot and cover finally. Boil for 5 minutes.
7. Reduce the stovetop temperature and allow the pot to reduce to a simmer. Simmer for another 15 - 30 minutes.
8. Check after every 15 minutes of simmering. The temperature at the thickest parts should be above 165°F.
9. Test by poking the meat with a chopstick, and looking at the juice that runs. The chicken is ready when there is no more red in the juice that flows out
10. Ready an ice bath, and plunge the chicken into the bath. Turn every few minutes, and allow the chicken to chill for 5 minutes before butchering.
