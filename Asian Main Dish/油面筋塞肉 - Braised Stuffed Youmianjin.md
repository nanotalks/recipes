## 2. Stuffing
|<!-- -->|<!-- -->|
|---|---|
| **2 bags** of gluten puffs | **500 g** of ground pork |
| **1** large egg | **2 stalks** of green onion, chopped finely |
| **Dash** of ground pepper | **Dash** of onion powder |
| **Dash** of garlic powder | **1 tsp** of Dijon mustard |
| **1tsp** of Worcestershire Sauce | **2 tsp** of Shaoxing cooking wine |

1. Mix all of the ingredients together. Avoid using excessive force or use stand-mixer to avoid the meat from heating up.
2. Examine each gluten puff for the weakest point on the surface, and poke a hole with the index finger
3. Using the index finger, slowly shovel the pork stuffing into the puff. Stop when there is resistance
4. Once all the gluten puffs are filled, if there are any remaining stuffing, inspect each of the gluten puff again. The gluten puffs may have softened a bit more, after coming in contact with the liquids in the stuffing, and allowing the puff to expand easier.
