| **800g** of boneless chicken drumsticks or thighs | **12 tbsp** of honey garlic sauce |

1. If the bones are still attached, carefully debone the chicken, keeping the meat in 1 piece 
2. Marinate the thighs or drumsticks for at least 30 minutes in the fridge, but ideally overnight
3. Heat up a large frying pan on low heat. Add the chicken into the pan as the pan is still heating up.
4. Wait until the fond in the frying pan starts bubbling, and wait another few (5) minutes before flipping.
5. Spoon any remaining marinade onto the chicken, and keep flipping every 3-5 minutes until the skin on the chicken starts to caramelize on both sides
6. Using an instant read thermometer, ensure the chicken has reached 165Â°F in the thickest parts of each piece before removing from the pan
