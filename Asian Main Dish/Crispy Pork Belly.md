1. Pat the pork belly dry
2. If the pork belly is in narrow strips that cannot stand skin side up, use a butchers twine to tie multiple slices together
3. If the pork belly is in larger pieces, score the underside of the pork belly with deep cuts so that seasoning makes better contact. Do not cut through the skin
4. Use a fork, or a meat tenderizer, poke holes into the skin. Push the metal prongs at most 1-2mm into the skin
5. Rub mustard over the underside of the pork belly
6. Mix together the five spice powder, both ground peppercorns and salt, and rub on the underside of the pork.
7. Wipe off any spice that gets on the skin.
