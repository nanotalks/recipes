## 2. Leftover Rice
|<!-- -->|<!-- -->|
|---|---|
| **2 cups** of rice | |

1. Wash and rinse **2 cups** of rice in a pot to remove starch
2. Add rice into a rice cooker and cook
3. Let the rice cool, and refrigerate overnight

## 3. Pineapple Engineering
|<!-- -->|<!-- -->|
|---|---|
| **1** large pineapple | **1/3 tsp** of table salt|

1. Start by trimming the top of the pineapple, so that it's easier to wield and plate. Remove or trim any loose or browning leaves.
2. Taking a sharp knife, cut a 1 inch thick slice of pineapple from one side of the fruit. This is the pineapple lid
3. Carve a bit out of the "lid" of the pineapple, to help with presentation. Reserve the carved fruit for later.
4. On the other side of the fruit, cut a 1/2 inch thick slice starting from the crown, BUT stop 1 inch from the bottom. The slice should still be attached at the bottom of the pineapple, and this flap will form as the bottom of the fruit when served.
5. Carve out the core of the pineapple. Use a knife, and starting on the first exposed side, cut a rectangle into the flesh of the fruit, about 1/2in in from the skin. Follow the skin from the crown to the bottom, and cut horizontally across at the top and bottom of the fruit.
6. Trace the knife around the cut once more, making sure the cut makes it through to the other side. From the partially cut side, push the core out.
7. Push a few toothpicks in through the bottom flap, and into the skin of the pineapple. Once the bottom flap is properly secured to the fruit, use a pair of shears to trim off excess lengths in toothpicks so that the fruit can lay flat on the bottom flap.
8. Quarter the core, and trim the tough centre by using a knife to gently feeling for where the core softens.
6. Slice up the soft flesh of the fruit in 1/2 in cubes. Reserve 1 cup for the rice, and the remainder can be salted and preserved as a snack
