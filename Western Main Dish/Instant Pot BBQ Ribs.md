|<!-- -->|<!-- -->|
|---|---|
| **6 tbsp** of BBQ rub | **2 tbsp** of mustard |

1. Pat the rib dry, trimming any excess fat from both sides
2. Remove silver skin (thin membrane) from the back of the rib (use a butter knife to start)
3. Apply a thin even layer of mustard to both sides of the ribs, to help the dry rub stick better to the ribs
4. Generously apply the dry rub to both sides of the rib
5. Rest the ribs in the InstantPot inner pot for 3 hours

## 3. Pressure cook
|<!-- -->|<!-- -->|
|---|---|
| **1 tbsp** light soy sauce | **1 tbsp** dark soy sauce |
| **2 tbsp** apple cider vinegar | **2 tbsp** honey |
| **1 tsp** of liquid smoke | **3 tbsp** whiskey |
| **4 cloves** of crushed garlic | **5 tbsp** ketchup |

1. Mix the ingredients into the inner pot of the Instant Pot
2. After resting the ribs for 3 hours, ensure the vent on the InstantPot is sealed, and set the pressure to high for 120min
3. Allow the InstantPot to naturally release pressure
4. Carefully remove the ribs from the inner pot, lay flat on a tray with meat side up, and sear with a torch

## 4. BBQ Sauce
|<!-- -->|<!-- -->|
|---|---|
| **1 tbsp** of cornstarch | **1 tbsp** of sweet soy sauce |
| **1 tbsp** of butter | **1 tsp** of liquid smoke |
| **2-3 pieces** of dried bayleaves | **1 sprigs** of thyme |

1. Bring the liquids in the InstantPot to a boil on medium heat
2. Mix the cornstarch with cold water until disolved, and add to the sauce
3. Add the remainder of the ingredients into the pot
4. Continue to stir the sauce constantly to prevent burning at the bottom of the pot. Reduce the heat but keep the sauce boiling
5. After the sauce thickens, about 15 minutes, strain out the solids in the sauce
6. Rub sauce onto the meat size of the ribs, and sear with torch again before serving
