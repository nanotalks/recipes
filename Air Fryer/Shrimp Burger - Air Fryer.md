|<!-- -->|<!-- -->|
|---|---|
| **200g** of shrimp, peeled and deveined | **2 slice** of bread|
| **2 tbsp** of mayonnaise | **1 tsp** of dijon mustard|
| **1/2 tsp** of garlic powder| **1/2 tsp** of onion powder |
| **1/2 tsp** of black peppercorn, freshly grounded | **1/2 tsp** of table salt |
| **1** large egg | **1 stalk** of green onion |

1. If using frozen shrimp, allow the shrimp to defrost in the refrigerator overnight
2. Place the slice of bread in a food processor and blend until bread crumbs.
3. In a separate bowl, add the bread crumbs, mayonnaise, dijon mustard, garlic powder, onion powder and freshly ground peppercorn.
4. If using frozen shrimps, do not add salt to the mixture (as frozen shrimps are typically already salty).
5. Pat the peeled and deveined shrimps dry with paper towel.
6. Place the shrimp in a food processor with an egg and green onions
7. Pulse the food processor until only small chunks of shrimp remain.
8. Add the shrimp to the patty batter, and mix evenly.
9. Divide the batter into 2, form round balls, and flatten on a tray. The patties will not change with size when cooked, so form to the desired size of the buns.
10. Cover the tray and place in the fridge for 30 min to allow the burgers to firm up.
