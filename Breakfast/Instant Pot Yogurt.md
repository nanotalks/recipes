1. Sanitize the Instant Pot by setting the pot on steam for 10 minutes and sealing the venting valve
2. Release the pressure after 10 minutes and pour out the water.
3. Allow the inner pot to air dry
4. Add 2L of whole milk into the inner pot of the Instant Pot. Select "Yogurt", and "Adjust" to set the mode to "boil".
5. Close the lid, leaving it in venting mode until the cycle is complete.
6. Check with a food thermometer that the milk temperature is around 175°F - 180°F.
7. Yogurt made from milk right after the Instant Pot reaches the end of the cycle is rather runny and drinkable. To thicken, set the Instant Pot to "Slow Cooker" mode, and hit "Adjust" to set slow cooker temperature to low, which should keep the Instant Pot at 170°F consistently. Set the timer for an additional 30 minutes
8. Place the inner pot on a counter top, and cover the inner pot with a lid. Allow milk to cool until 105°F - 115°F, and the lid should prevent a skin from forming. This should take around 2.5 hours when the kitchen is at room temperature.
9. After about 2 hours of cooling, start preheating the Instant Pot. Set the Instant Pot to Yogurt mode, for 5.5 - 8 hours.
10. After 2.5 hours of cooling, place the inner pot back into the Instant Pot.
11. Place 2 tbsp of plain yogurt into the milk, and the inner pot back into the Instant Pot.
12. Allow the yogurt to ferment, at least for 8 hours. The Instant Pot does not need to be on for the whole duration, as the insulation will keep the yogurt warm enough. The longer the yogurt is left in the Instant Pot, and the longer the Instant Pot is kept on Yogurt mode, the more tart and thick the yogurt gets, so adjust timing based on personal preference. Leave the pot somewhere undisturbed and the seal in venting mode.
13. Once the timer has expired, remove 2 tbsp of yogurt and freeze immediately for future use
Bottle and refrigerate the yogurt with optional toppings
