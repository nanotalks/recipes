|<!-- -->|<!-- -->|
|---|---|
| **1-3 lb** live dungeness crab | **4 slices** of ginger |
| **3 tbsp** Chinese black vinegar | |

1. *Optional:* If the dungeness is not cooked immediately, fill a sink up with cold water to partially submerge the crab, and mix in about a tsp of salt. Crabs can be kept like this for a few hours, not overnight.
2. In a large steamer, add about 3 cups of cold water. Add the dungeness crabs into the pot on a steaming rack or trivet before turning the heat to high.
3. When the water starts boiling, keep the heat on high for 1 minute
4. After 1 minute, reduce the stove to medium, and allow the crab to steam for another 14 minutes.
5. After the timer runs out, remove the crab from the steamer, plate, and allow the crab to sit out for a few minutes while preparing the dip.
6. Mince the slices of ginger finely, and place in a dip dish.
7. Add about **2-3 tbsp** of vinegar to the dip dish, to completely cover the ginger.
8. Serve together when the crab is comfortable to the touch.
